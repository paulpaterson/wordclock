# The prompt to create the ui front and back end


write a web application with html as a front end and flask python as a back end.
Do not use react or any other ui framework for the front end.
The page should allow the user to edit the following parameters:

- "Show it is" - can be either True or False
- "Show A" - can be either True or False
- "Interval" - is a floating point number
- "Light color" - is a color expressed in RGB that the user can pull from a color picker
- "Face mode" - can be one of "10x11", "14x5", "16x16"
- "Mode" - which you can select multiple of "Normal", "EdgeLightSeconds", "TestEdge", "TestWords", "FlashWords"
- "Baud rate" - which is an integer


The flask back end should get and set the results to a file, "config.sh" which sets environment variables
which are named like the parameters above except that they have a prefix of "CLOCK_"

It should also include a route (to "/config") that returns the HTML you generated.

Show both the HTML and Python back end.


Things not added

- Add CLOCK_LIGHT_MODE = detect, real, simulated, off
- Make sure to include "export" on the script lines so that it can be run as a bash script
- Initialise the properties from the config script when the page loads
- Set the interval time to be more reasonable
